# Spotlight test for Serban Ontanu-Craciun

I chose to do 1. Recipe, 2. Javascript Functions and attempted 5. Webpage bug hunt.

Usually I use 1 commit per bug, but I was pressed for time.

I also did 4. Tic Tac Toe last night out of curiosity and in order to get acquainted with hosting on Github Pages, but the whole thing took about 2-3 hours so I won't add it as part of the test, though I felt like putting it here just as well.
